# AI-Project

Hitori is a popular Japanese game, weâ€™ll be using various AI algorithms of informed and local search type to solve this game and further we will also be comparing their space and time complexities to find out which algorithm is better than others.

Hitori (Alone  in Japanese) is a type  of logic puzzle. Board of the  game  is a grid of cells containing a number. The goal is not to have more than one identical number in each row or column. Three main rules of Hitori are:

- There must not be any duplicate numbers in any rows or columns.
- Black cells cannot be adjacent, although they can be diagonal to one another.
- There must not be 4 black cells around a white one.

The chosen programming language for this project is C++. It is the fastest computer language, which makes it great for AI programming projects that are time sensitive. It provides faster execution time and has a quicker response time.
